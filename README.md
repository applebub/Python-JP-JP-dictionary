# Python-JP-JP-dictionary

It is my first school unrelated Python project, hence it's not pretty, but I think it serves it's role . 
For my anki flashcards I wanted to make simple code which  creates from list of japanese words, corresponding  list of japanese defintion. 
I cold't find similiar programs for jp - jp, though there are plenty for eng-jp.
